SensorSimulator lets you simulate sensor events from 
accelerometer, compass, orientation, and temperature sensors.
It transmits the simulated sensor data to an Android emulator.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   THIS IS A JAVA STANDALONE APPLICATION

* To launch it, open the sensorsimulator.jar file with your JRE
  (requires Java Runtime Environment 1.6.0 or higher).
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

---------------------------------------------------------
release: 0.1.6
date: 2008-04-09

- no changes

---------------------------------------------------------
release: 0.1.5
date: 2008-03-28

- Performance patch included (by Ogurash).
- Special characters implemented as unicode.

---------------------------------------------------------
release: 0.1.4
date: 2008-03-12

new features:
  - support for Sensors class updateSensorRate() and related methods.
  - new physical model for accelerometer that allows for higher 
    time-resolution. Accelerometer can be specified by spring constant
    and damping terms.

---------------------------------------------------------
release: 0.1.3
date: 2008-02-24

new features:
  - update interval can be set and is monitored
  - more settings for accelerometer / acceleration:
    pixel per meter, limit for accelerometer.
  - random contribution to sensors
  
known issues:
  - the new Sensors methods related to sensor update
    rate are not yet implemented.

---------------------------------------------------------
release: 0.1.2
date: 2008-01-28

new features:
  - runs as standalone Java application
  - also runs as Java applet in web browser, but
    connection to Android emulator is not possible 
    due to browser security restrictions
  - sensors: accelerometer, compass, orientation, temperature
  - settings: gravity, magnetic field, temperature

known issues:
  - requires JRE 1.6.
  - official definitions or compass and orientation 
    sensors are not fully specified.
    Currently these definitions are used:
    - compass: magnetic field in micro-Tesla
    - orientation: yaw, pitch, and roll (in this order)
      in degree from -180 to +180.
    - temperature: temperature in degree Celsius
